# Netflix Movie Recommendation Engine

# 📖 Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science application that analyzes the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a content-based movie recommendation system. The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

The goal is to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on the content of a movie they like, considering factors such as genre, director, cast, and description.

# ✨ Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: A robust script to clean the raw dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis and visualization of the dataset to uncover patterns, such as content distribution, top genres, and content growth over time.

Content-Based Recommendation Model: A machine learning model built using scikit-learn that recommends movies based on content similarity. It calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.

Interactive Web Application: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit that allows users to select a movie from a dropdown and instantly receive the top 10 recommendations.
